# Gate - Galaxy Automated Training environment
Tools to export and import Galaxy server ( https://galaxyproject.org/ )shared data libraries, published workflows, 
tool inventories plus course notes between development and training deploys of Galaxy.
This allows material to be developed on one instance and then deployed to a barebones instance e.g. in a Docker container
that is then used to deliver the course.
The aim is to develop python tools and use the Galaxy API calls to provide the functionality
